Thinking on making tourism related project
Will use control and interactions
Will use AI to give answers to the questions of users about places.
Let's say they are looking for Taj Mahal then we will show them Taj Mahal, we will make
them roam around Taj Mahal, circular view of Taj Mahal
AI will show them about Taj Mahal, how they can plan there trip for it, there stay opportunities etc.

# Second Idea
W will play games. People will get games instructions
Example - Game will be like there will be a area. In that area robbers digged some money,
gold and you got to know it. You have to find where they digged it.\

Example 2 - You are given a place where there are some places where puzzles are hidden.
Number of puzzles present in that area will be given. 

Example 3 - You are given some hints on maps and you have to identify location and then with places api you will go to that location and take one secret code from there and insert into our hunt field which will be given before start of the gam and you willl put it there.

Example 4 - We will use it for marketing. We will giv some hints to user then they will identify th brand and go to hadoffice of the brand.
